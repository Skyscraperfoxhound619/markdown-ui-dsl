## The Problem
Visual wireframes (Figma, PNGs) are token-heavy, prone to AI hallucination, and hard to version control. Natural language prompts often lack deterministic structure, leading to inconsistent UI generation.

## The Solution
This project provides a strict Markdown-based Intermediate Representation (IR). Product managers can write easily readable low-fidelity specs, and AI agents can parse them with deterministic accuracy to generate React, Vue, HTML, or any other UI code.

## Installation & Setup
For the smoothest experience, you should integrate the skill file into your AI agent's specific instruction architecture.

### 1. GitHub Copilot (Agent Mode)
Copilot Agent mode works best when using its explicit Skill architecture. Set it up using these steps:

1. Initialise your `copilot-instructions.md` by asking Copilot to setup your project for AI agent assistance, or manually create `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
2. Create a folder for the skill and download the DSL instructions:
```bash
mkdir -p .github/skills/markdown-ui-agent
curl -o .github/skills/markdown-ui-agent/SKILL.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MegaByteMark/markdown-ui-dsl/main/skill/markdown-ui-agent.md
```
3. Open your `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file and add the following mapping:
```markdown
## Skills
- For interpreting `ui.md` files, use the `markdown-ui-agent` skill to generate components based on the specifications provided.
```

### 2. Cursor / Roo Code / Cline
For agents that use single flat rules files, you can append the skill directly:
```bash
# For Cursor (picks up from .cursorrules)
curl -o .cursorrules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MegaByteMark/markdown-ui-dsl/main/skill/markdown-ui-agent.md

# For Cline/Roo Code (picks up from .clinerules)
curl -o .clinerules https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MegaByteMark/markdown-ui-dsl/main/skill/markdown-ui-agent.md
```

## Recommended Project Structure
To keep your specs organized and cleanly separated from your application code, we highly recommend creating a `wireframes` folder at the root of your project to hold your DSL designs and your design system file:

```text
my-app/
├── .github/
│   ├── copilot-instructions.md
│   └── skills/markdown-ui-agent/SKILL.md
├── src/
│   └── components/
└── wireframes/
    ├── design-system.md
    └── login-form.ui.md
```

*(Alternative for Dev-Heavy Teams: You can also choose to **Colocate** your `.ui.md` files directly next to their resulting components in the `src/` directory. If you do this, we recommend moving the rules from `design-system.md` directly into your global agent instructions file so you don't have to manage complex relative pathing in your frontmatter).*

## Workflow
1. **Spec Generation:** Create a new `.ui.md` file in your `wireframes/` folder or ask your AI: "Plan a login page using the Markdown-UI DSL and save it to `wireframes/login.ui.md`."
2. **Human Review:** A PM or developer reviews the generated `.ui.md` file and edits the text layout easily.
3. **Code Generation:** Open an Agent Chat and prompt it: "Create the opening page of the app as a login page and create a component for it from `wireframes/login-form.ui.md`."

## Syntax Quick Reference
Here is a brief overview of the Markdown-UI DSL syntax. Because it relies heavily on natural visual metaphors, it's incredibly fast to read and write without looking at a manual. For the exact AI instruction set, see the [skill/markdown-ui-agent.md](skill/markdown-ui-agent.md) file.

### Layouts
- **Containers:** `||| COLUMN |||` for vertical stacking, `=== ROW ===` for flex-row alignment.
- **Surfaces:** `::: CARD :::` or `::: MODAL :::` for elevated containers.
- **Boundaries:** End *any* layout block with `--- END ---`.
- **Dividers:** `***` for horizontal visual breaks.

### Components
- **Text & Lists:** Use standard Markdown (`#`, `**bold**`, `- list item`). Everything naturally parses.
- **Buttons / Actions:** `[ Button Name ](#action)`
- **Text Inputs:** `[ text: Placeholder content ]`
- **Checkboxes:** `[ ] Unchecked` or `[x] Checked`
- **Radio Buttons:** `( ) Option` or `(x) Selected`
- **Toggles:** `[on] Enabled` or `[off] Disabled`
- **Dropdowns / Selects:** `[v] Selected Value {Option 1, Option 2}`
- **Tabs:** `|[ Active Tab ]| Tab 2 | Tab 3 |`
- **Badges / Tags:** `(( Premium ))`
- **Images:** `[ IMG: User Avatar (rounded) ]`

## Design Theming
The Markdown-UI DSL strongly separates structure from style. You can use YAML frontmatter at the top of your `.ui.md` specs to instruct the AI to follow a specific UI framework or custom design system document:

```yaml
---
framework: Next.js + TailwindCSS + Shadcn UI
theme: ./design-system.md
---
```

By writing your styling rules, design tokens, and standard CSS classes into a single `design-system.md` file, the AI agent will consistently apply your branding and layout guidelines across every component it generates. Check out the `examples/design-system.md` file for inspiration.

## Events & Interactivity
You do **not** need to map complex state logic, API calls, or event handlers in the UI DSL. That falls outside the scope of a wireframe and belongs in your overarching SDD (Spec-Driven Development) principles or user stories. 

The DSL captures the *intent* of an action using standard markdown link syntax on buttons:
* `[ Login ](#login)` -> Indicates a trigger/event handler needs to be mapped.
* `[ Forgot Password ](/reset-password)` -> Indicates a route change.

When you pass the `.ui.md` file to the AI Agent, you should provide the behavior alongside it in your prompt or a separate requirements document, like so:
*"Generate the component from `login-form.ui.md`. When `#login` is clicked, mock an API call setting `isLoading` to true, and route to `/dashboard` on success."*
